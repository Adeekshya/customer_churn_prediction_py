# customer_churn_prediction_py
Extracted a dataset via Kaggle,
Data Preprocessed including cleaning, and preparing it before it was used for data analysis and machine learning,
Deployed machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree, Naive Bayis Algorithm and Logistic Regression,
Seperated the data into training and testing set. Training set: we use to build the model and Testing set: we use to evaluate the model,
Once satisfied with the model performance,I used the unknown data and put that through the model and received prediction about the customers
